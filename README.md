# Air-Quality-Dashboard
This repository contains an Air Quality Dashboard using the Dash and Plotly libraries in Python.

**Note:** This is still a work in progress. Currently, the Dashboard contains a heatmap of Air Quality data spanning a six month time period in Salt Lake. There is a dropdown that contains the two types of measurements for AQI: PM2.5 and Ozone. I plan to add more interactive features to this dashboard soon!
